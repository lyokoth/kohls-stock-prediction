# kohls stock portfolio

A stock price prediction analysis for Kohl's Corporation (KSS) using Machine Learning. 




Step 1 was to import the necessary Python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) as well as Facebook's library Prophet. I then gathered historical data for Kohl's stock prices by downloading the .csv from Yahoo Finance. 


After downloading the data, I visualized it by using matplotlib. 

The first graph shows the "Close" column which represents the close prices of the dates at Kohl's. The graphs represents the closing prices decreasing with each date.



The next model is a scatterplot, predicting that prices have peaked for a while in March 2022, but have continued to decrease since then.
